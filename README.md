This is a user registration form with Insert , delete, and updation functionality.

FUNCTIONALITY
------------------
1) Insert- in the first page of user registartion you can enter all the details and the data gets inserted into the database which is then read into the second page as you click submit.
2) Update - In the second page you can edit/updste your username which is read and displayed in the same page colored in green. This is also edited in the database.
3) Delete -  You will see a button with "Delete user" label on clicking it the user will be deregistered or deleted from the database.

The project has dockerfile and a Docker-compose.yml file which separates the application and database for the containers/images creation.

I have also ran the appliaction on docker by creating image and also docker compose too. It worked fine for me.
